## Day-4
1) aiml_day4_assignment1.ipynb
     Research on whether addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division and modulo

## Day-5
1) aiml_day5_assignment1.ipynb
     Write a Python program to find the first 20 non-even prime natural numbers.

       Write a Python program to check if the given string is a Palindrome or 
       Anagram or None of them. Display the message accordingly to the user.
4) aiml_day5_assignment4.ipynb
     Write a Python's user defined function that removes all the additional 
     characters from the string and converts it finally to lower case using 
     built-in lower(). eg: If the string is "Dr. Darshan Ingle @AI-ML Trainer", 
     then the output be "drdarshaningleaimltrainer".  
## Day-6
1) aiml_day6_assignment1.ipynb
     Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" 
     format, please write program to print the company name of a given email address. 
     Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.
     
     Input Format:
              The first line of the input contains an email address.
     Output Format:
              Print the company name in single line.

     Example:
              Input:
                       john@google.com
              Output:
                       google
2) aiml_day6_assignment2.ipynb
     Write a program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and 
     prints the words in a comma separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

     Input Format:
              The first line of input contains words separated by the comma.
     Output Format:
              Print the sorted words separated by the comma.

     Example:
              Input:
                       without,hello,bag,world
              Output:
                       bag,hello,without,world  
3) aiml_day6_assignment3.ipynb
     Create your own Jupyter Notebook for Sets.
     Reference link: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp
4) aiml_day6_assignment4.ipynb
     Given a list of n-1 numbers ranging from 1 to n, your task is to find the missing 
     number. There are no duplicates.

     Input Format:
              The first line contains n-1 numbers with each number separated by a space.
     Output Format:
              Print the missing number

     Example:
              Input:1 2 4 6 3 7 8
     Output:5

     Explanation:
              In the above list of numbers 5 is missing and hence 5 is the output
5) aiml_day6_assignment5.ipynb
     With a given list L, write a program to print this list L after removing all 
     duplicate values with original order reserved.
     
     Example:
              If the input list is
              12 24 35 24 88 120 155 88 120 155
              Then the output should be
              12 24 35 88 120 155

     Explanation:
              Third, seventh and ninth element of the list L has been removed because 
              it was already present.

     Input Format:
              In one line take the elements of the list L with each element separated 
              by a space.
     Output Format:
              Print the elements of the modified list in one line with each element separated 
              by a space.

     Example:
              Input: 12 24 35 24
     Output:
              12 24 35

     Attached dataset analyze the problem statement mentioned  below,
              ● A sizable department has to be maintained, for the purposes
                of recruiting new talent
              ● More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for 
                the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company
              ● Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm to 
                understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition.
              ● In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their 
                workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.
              ● Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and 
                needs to be addressed right away.
